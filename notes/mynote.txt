res.send is just for text or HTML response

 app.get("/", (req, res) => {

 //middleware : 

 1) morgan() morgan is not a middlewear , it is a funtion which will calls and return middler ware

 const logger = function(req,res,next) --> it is a middleware function because it will not call but it will passes
 like this app.use(logger)

 2) If one object or function have to exports than we can use exports.module but if we want to exports multiple objects or function than we have to use exports.functionname or objectname
